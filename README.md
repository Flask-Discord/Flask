# Flask
## A fully open source discord bot designed for servers big or small 
## Flask is packed with features like music, polls and much more.

#### Flask is made with nodejs and discord.js-v13 and is purely open to code edits and reviews, this to make our bot as transparent as possible and to let our bot be as safe as possible

# Developers

### If you want to use this without making major modifications you will need to run `node setup.js` to create the configuration files located outside the root folder. Then run `npm install` and it should work perfectly when you run `node .` <3
